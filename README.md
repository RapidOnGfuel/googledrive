# To Do
- [x] Add filtering for movies on watch.html and movies.html 
- [ ] Lock the size of the filter for the watch.html and allow users to scroll and search instead of making the search the whole page
- [ ] Add more filtering options, easier ways to get around goguardian, etc
- [ ] Work into an uploadable version of this that anyone can host from anywhere (minus the movies, just frontend and a easy way to upload own movies for personal use only)
- [ ] Develop UI, make it more clean (+ user friendly)
